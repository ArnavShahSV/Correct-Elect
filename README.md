# Correct-Elect
Correct Elect is a project that my friend and I created at Los Altos Hacks. Originally, we wanted to create an interactive app to inform
citizens about up coming elections and what representatives they have. But, we soon realized that many people might not want to download 
an app. This led us to create Correct-Elect. A simple and elegant website that tells users who their senators and congressional reps are,
which congressional district they are in, and their representative's party affiliations.
